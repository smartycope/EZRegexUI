# EZRegexUI
This is a nice frontend for the [EZRegex](https://github.com/smartycope/ezregex) library. It essentially works the same as the .test() method in that library, only as a website instead of through the command line.

You can see this live at [ezregex.org](https://ezregex.org/) and [ezregex.streamlit.app](https://ezregex.streamlit.app/).
